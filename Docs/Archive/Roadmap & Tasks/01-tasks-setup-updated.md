**Feature Area:** Initial Project Setup  
**Last Updated:** May 10, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

## ðŸŒŸ Git Workflow for This Feature

```
# 1. Initialize repository with main branch âœ…
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [your-repository-url]
git push -u origin main

# 2. Create develop branch from main âœ…
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# 3. Create feature branch for project setup âœ…
git checkout -b feature/project-setup

# 4. Make focused commits for each component
git add [files]
git commit -m "feat: initialize Next.js project"
git add [files]
git commit -m "feat: configure Tailwind and shadcn/ui"

# 5. Push feature branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/project-setup

# 6. If develop changes during setup:
git fetch origin develop
git merge origin/develop
# Resolve any conflicts that arise

# 7. When setup is complete:
# Create pull request from feature/project-setup to develop
# Include description of setup components and configuration

# 8. After review and approval, merge to develop
# This will deploy to staging environment automatically

# 9. Test on staging environment:
# - Verify all configurations work
# - Check environment variables are set correctly
# - Test authentication flow

# 10. After successful verification on staging:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/project-setup
```

## Notes & Decisions

- Decided to use Clerk over custom auth for faster development
- Using Railway for PostgreSQL due to familiarity
- Next.js App Router (not Pages Router) for future compatibility
- Chose shadcn/ui for component library due to customization options
- Successfully set up GitHub with multiple account configuration (SSH keys)
- Branch structure created following GitFlow standards (main, develop, feature branches)
- Implemented custom auth UI with Clerk backend for better user experience
- Added specific integration notes for Clerk and tRPC to the development standards document
- Successfully integrated profile management with database sync
- Completed database setup with Railway PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM
- Full schema created and migrated to database
- Fixed tRPC context to properly include database and user information
