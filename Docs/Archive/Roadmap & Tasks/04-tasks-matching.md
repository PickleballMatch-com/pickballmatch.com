# Matching System Tasks
**Feature Area:** Matching & Swiping Interface  
**Last Updated:** May 10, 2025  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Planned Start:** After User Profiles

## ðŸŒŸ Git Workflow for This Feature

```
# 1. Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/matching-system

# 2. Work on tasks, committing regularly
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement matching algorithm"

# 3. Push branch to remote (first time)
git push -u origin feature/matching-system

# 4. Subsequent pushes
git push

# 5. When feature is complete, create PR to develop
# Use GitHub interface to create PR

# 6. After PR approval and merge to develop, test on staging
# Staging deployment happens automatically with develop branch

# 7. Clean up feature branch after merge
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/matching-system
```

## Database Models & API

### Matching Schema
- [ ] Define matching-related models in Prisma
  - [ ] MatchPreference model
  - [ ] PotentialMatch model
  - [ ] ReachOut model
  - [ ] Connection model
- [ ] Create schema relations
  - [ ] User to MatchPreference (one-to-one)
  - [ ] User to ReachOut (one-to-many)
  - [ ] User to Connection (many-to-many)
- [ ] Create migrations for matching tables
- [ ] Add indexes for performance optimization

### Matching Algorithm
- [ ] Design algorithm interface and parameters
- [ ] Implement core matching algorithm
  - [ ] DUPR compatibility scoring
  - [ ] Location proximity calculation
  - [ ] Preference weighting system
  - [ ] Travel date overlap detection
- [ ] Create algorithm unit tests
- [ ] Implement filter system:
  - [ ] Age filter
  - [ ] DUPR range filter
  - [ ] Gender filter
  - [ ] Location radius filter
  - [ ] Match type filter (casual, tournament, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize algorithm for performance

### API Routes
- [ ] Create tRPC router for matching
- [ ] Implement endpoints:
  - [ ] Get potential matches (with pagination)
  - [ ] Apply match filters
  - [ ] Add user to reach-out list
  - [ ] Remove from reach-out list
  - [ ] Get reach-out list
  - [ ] Mark as connected
- [ ] Set up validation schemas
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

---

## Testing & Refinement

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test matching algorithm accuracy
- [ ] Test filter functionality
- [ ] Test reach-out list management

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete matching flow
- [ ] Test filter application and results
- [ ] Test reach-out to messaging transition

### Load Testing

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: User Profiles, Authentication
- **Required by**: Messaging system

---

## Status Tracking

- **Planned Start**: After profiles completion
- **Target Completion**: 2 weeks after start
- **Current Progress**: 0%

## Notes & Decisions

- Swiping interface will follow Tinder-style UX but with pickleball-specific metrics
- Algorithm will prioritize skill level compatibility (DUPR)
- Need to handle cases where user pool is small in certain locations
- Reach-out list is distinct from actual connections (requires mutual interest)
- Will consider implementing "boost" functionality for premium users
