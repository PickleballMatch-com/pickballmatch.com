## ðŸŒŸ Git Workflow for This Feature

```
# 1. Update develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create feature branch for authentication
git checkout -b feature/authentication

# 3. Make focused commits with meaningful messages
git add [files]
git commit -m "feat: configure Clerk authentication"

git add [files]
git commit -m "feat: implement sign-in page"

git add [files]
git commit -m "feat: add authentication middleware"

# 4. Push to remote repository
git push -u origin feature/authentication

# 5. Keep branch updated with develop
git fetch origin develop
git merge origin/develop
# Resolve any conflicts

# 6. When feature is ready for review:
# - Run tests
# - Verify functionality in dev environment
# - Check code quality

# 7. Create pull request to develop branch
# Include:
# - Screenshots of authentication UI
# - Description of implemented features
# - Testing done

# 8. After review approval, merge to develop
# Staging will deploy automatically

# 9. Verify on staging environment:
# - Test sign-up flow
# - Test sign-in flow 
# - Test authentication middleware
# - Verify protected routes

# 10. Clean up after successful verification
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/authentication
```

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Basic project setup
- **Required by**: All authenticated features

---

## Status Tracking

- **Planned Start**: During setup phase
- **Target Completion**: End of setup phase
- **Current Progress**: 0%

## Notes & Decisions

- Using Clerk to avoid building custom auth
- Email verification will be required
- Social login options for simplified onboarding
- Authentication must be completed before other features
- MFA will be optional but encouraged for user accounts
