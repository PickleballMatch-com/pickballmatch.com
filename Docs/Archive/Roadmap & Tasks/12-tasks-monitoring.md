## Notes & Decisions

- Sentry chosen for error tracking due to Next.js integration
- Structured logging approach to be used throughout the application
- Performance monitoring will focus on both technical metrics and user experience
- Need to balance monitoring detail with cost considerations
- Privacy concerns to be addressed in analytics implementation
- Error tracking to be implemented early in the development process
- Performance optimization to be an ongoing process rather than one-time effort
