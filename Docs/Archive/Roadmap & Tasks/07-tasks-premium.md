## Notes & Decisions

- Two-tier subscription model: Premium and Dating (includes Premium)

- Dating features completely separate from regular matching
- Need to be careful with dating privacy and safety features
- Affiliate revenue as secondary monetization strategy
- Free tier should still provide good value to drive adoption
