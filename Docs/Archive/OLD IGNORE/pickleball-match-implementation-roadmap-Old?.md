## Implementation Tips

### Development Approach
1. **Start with a working foundation:** Get authentication, database, and basic routing working before building features
2. **Incremental development:** Complete each feature before moving to the next
3. **Daily commits:** Make regular commits to track progress and avoid losing work
4. **Component-first development:** Build reusable components that can be combined for features
5. **Test on real devices:** Don't rely solely on browser emulation for mobile testing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Scope creep:** Stick to the roadmap and avoid adding new features until core functionality is complete
2. **Premature optimization:** Build working features first, then optimize
3. **Neglecting error handling:** Implement proper error handling and user feedback from the start
4. **Inconsistent UI:** Establish component patterns and stick to them
5. **Poor mobile experience:** Consider mobile users throughout development

### Technical Debt Management
1. **Document as you go:** Add comments and documentation while code is fresh
2. **Refactor regularly:** Set aside time for cleanup and refactoring
3. **Track known issues:** Keep a list of technical debt to address later
4. **Test automation:** Implement basic tests for critical paths
5. **Code reviews:** Even self-reviews help catch issues early
