## Instructions for Using This Tracker

1. Update the "Current Status" section whenever you switch active branches
2. Log branch creations in the "Branch Creation Log" table
3. Log pull requests in the "Pull Request Log" table
4. Log releases and version tags in the "Release Log" table
5. Add entries to the "Action Log" whenever you perform significant Git operations

This tracking helps maintain clarity about the project's Git history, especially during the learning phase of using Git Flow branching strategy.

## Next Planned Actions

- [x] Create develop branch from main
- [x] Create feature/project-setup branch from develop
- [ ] Implement initial project setup
- [ ] Create PR from feature/project-setup to develop
- [ ] Test on staging
- [ ] Eventually release to production
