- Travel features will use badge system rather than calendar approach
- Location data will focus on cities first, courts/venues can be added later
- Notifications will be opt-in to avoid overwhelming users
- Travel planning should be simple with minimal required fields
- Google Maps API will be used for location services
- Need to consider privacy implications of location sharing
