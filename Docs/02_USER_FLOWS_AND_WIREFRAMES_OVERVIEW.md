**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2024-05-16
**Author:** Project Team (Compiled by AI Assistant)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an overview and central reference point for the user flows and wireframes designed for the Pickleball Match application. Understanding these elements is crucial for developing an intuitive and effective user experience.

*   **User Flows** define the paths users take through the application to complete specific tasks and achieve their goals. They help ensure a logical and seamless interaction sequence.
*   **Wireframes** provide a low-fidelity visual blueprint of the application's screens, focusing on structure, layout, information hierarchy, and functionality. They serve as a guide for UI development.

## 2. Detailed User Flows

Comprehensive user flows for various key interactions within the Pickleball Match platform are documented in detail. These flows cover processes such as new user onboarding, profile creation, matching, messaging, travel planning, and more.

*   **Primary Document:** [Detailed User Flows](./02a_USER_FLOWS_DETAIL.md)
    *   This document outlines step-by-step user journeys for critical application features.

## 3. Wireframes and Mockups

A collection of wireframes has been created to visualize the layout and structure of various application screens. These wireframes guide the UI development process and help ensure a consistent user interface.

*   **Wireframes Directory:** [Wireframes and Mockups](./wireframes%20and%20mockups/)
    *   This directory contains all individual HTML wireframe files (e.g., `wireframe-dashboard.html`, `wireframe-profile-view.html`, etc.).
*   **List of Wireframes:** [List of Wireframes to Create](./wireframes%20and%20mockups/pickleball-match-list%20of%20wireframes%20to%20create.md)
    *   This document serves as a checklist and overview of the visual design tasks for different application screens.

## 4. Key User Journeys Represented

The user flows and wireframes aim to cover, but are not limited to, the following critical user journeys:

*   New User Onboarding & Profile Setup
*   Finding and Connecting with Play Partners (Casual, Tournament, Drilling)
*   Messaging and Communication
*   Travel Planning and Connecting with Locals
*   Community Engagement (Groups, Discussions, Events)
*   Premium Feature Upgrades
*   Dating Profile Creation and Matching (Singles Feature)
*   Equipment Tracking and Review

## 5. Usage in Development

*   **Development Guidance:** Developers and AI agents should refer to these user flows and wireframes when implementing features to ensure the intended user experience is achieved.
*   **UI/UX Consistency:** These documents help maintain consistency in design and interaction patterns across the application.
*   **Reference for Testing:** User flows provide a basis for creating test cases and scenarios for Quality Assurance.

## 6. Evolution of Flows and Wireframes

As the Pickleball Match application evolves, user flows and wireframes may be updated or new ones added. Any significant changes should be:
1.  Discussed and agreed upon by the project team.
2.  Reflected in the relevant detailed documents (`02a_USER_FLOWS_DETAIL.md` or individual wireframe files).
3.  Summarized or noted in the `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` if the change impacts architecture or core functionality.
