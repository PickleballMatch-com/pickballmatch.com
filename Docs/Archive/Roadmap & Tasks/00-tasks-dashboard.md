- **Current Branch**: Working on `feature/project-setup` branch
- **Development Approach**: Web-first with Next.js, building in vertical slices (complete features)
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus on critical paths, expanding coverage as the project matures
- **Task Updates**: This dashboard is updated at the beginning and end of each development session
- **Completion Criteria**: Features are only considered complete when merged to `develop` and verified on staging
