## Complete-Test-Merge Process Tracking

For every feature development, we'll follow this standardized workflow:

### Planning Phase
- Create GitHub issue with requirements
- Break down into tasks in project board
- Assign story points or complexity rating
- Set acceptance criteria

### Development Phase
- Create feature branch from `develop`
- Implement code following standards document
- Write tests covering functionality
- Self-review using checklist:
  - Code quality standards met
  - No hardcoded values
  - Error handling implemented
  - Documentation added
  - Tests written

### Testing Phase
- Run all automated tests
- Deploy to preview environment
- Manually test on multiple devices
- Check edge cases and error states
- Verify against acceptance criteria

### Review & Merge Phase
- Create pull request with detailed description
- Reference GitHub issue in PR
- Add screenshots or videos demonstrating feature
- Address review comments
- Merge to `develop` after approval
- Deploy to staging environment
- Verify integration with existing features
- Close associated issues

### Tracking
Each feature will have a status in one of these categories:
- **Not Started**: Planning phase not complete
- **In Progress**: Active development
- **In Review**: PR created, awaiting review
- **Testing**: Merged to develop, in testing
- **Complete**: Verified on staging, ready for release

---

## Version Control & Release Strategy

### Branch Strategy
```
main              Production-ready code
  ↑
develop           Integration branch
  ↑
feature/XXX       Feature branches
bugfix/XXX        Bug fix branches
hotfix/XXX        Emergency fixes
```

### Release Process
1. Feature branches merge to `develop` via PR
2. `develop` is continuously deployed to staging
3. When ready for release:
   - Create `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from `develop`
   - Perform final testing
   - Merge to `main` via PR
   - Tag with version number
   - Deploy to production

### Versioning
We follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (v1.0.0, v2.0.0)
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible (v1.1.0, v1.2.0)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible (v1.0.1, v1.0.2)
